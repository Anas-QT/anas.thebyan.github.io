      Hello there, Stranger. My name is Anas. If you don’t know me, then well, I
      really don’t know how you ended up here! You’re welcome nonetheless!!!

      My name is Anas, I’m 21 years old, I’m currently a Medical Student in
      Jordan, I like adventure, and I love to learn new things (I honestly think
      this is an issue sometimes, seriously, I never get to get good at anything
      before switching to the newer fancier project :D)
    </p>
    <p>Here is how I look like! ----></p>
    <p>(To see more of me, click on the picture ^-^)</p>
    <p>
      I have created this website as a mean of learning to code. This has been
      one of the many side projects that have been at the back of my head since
      I was a highschooler. I finally decided to get off my ass and start
      checking them off from my goals-bucket-list, wish me luck!
    </p>
    <p>
      I don’t really know what the final product of this will look like yet, but
      while you’re here, I hope you enjoy the journey :)
    </p>
    <p>Next Action Steps for this website:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Change the Design Layout of my website into a Grid (this will give me
        more control over how I design different elements)
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the layout of some elements of my website into a Flexbox layout
        (this will improve the readability on different screen sizes, i.e.,
        smartphones)
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a Pages Section (the 3 lines you usually see on the corner of web
        pages)
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a Free Playground Page (where I can do fun experiments using JS)
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a Books Review Page where I share my very subjective opinion and
        review on books I've read
      </li>
    </ol>
